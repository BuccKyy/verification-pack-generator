Doc 04 — Mock Memo on Versioning & Authority Currency [PUBLIC MOCK]
===================================================================

L001: Legal authority is time-sensitive: later amendments and decisions can change the applicable rule.

L003: When relying on regulations, confirm commencement dates and savings provisions.
L004: When relying on case law, confirm whether it has been appealed.
L005: If the appellate outcome is unknown, treat reliance as provisional.
L006: Maintain a version log for research that records: source, date accessed, and version identifier.
L007: For internal knowledge bases, store the commit hash or document revision ID.
L008: If a citation refers to a repealed section, flag it as invalid.
L009: If there are conflicting authorities, present both and explain the conflict.
