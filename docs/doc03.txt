Doc 03 — Mock Guidance on Citation Accuracy (Legal Research) [PUBLIC MOCK]
==========================================================================

L001: A citation is accurate only if the cited source supports the specific proposition stated.
L002: A source that is merely related is not sufficient support.
L003: When citing cases, cite the relevant paragraph(s) for the proposition.
L004: If a proposition depends on multiple authorities, cite each authority separately.
L005: Do not cite headnotes as a substitute for reading the judgment text.
L006: If the law has changed, older authorities may be of limited value.
L007: Always check whether the cited authority has been overruled or distinguished.
L008: For statutes, cite the current consolidated version and the specific section.
L009: For subsidiary legislation, verify the effective date and amendments.
L010: If the supporting passage is ambiguous, label the proposition as uncertain.
