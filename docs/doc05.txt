Doc 05 — Mock Email Thread Excerpt (Project Scope) [PUBLIC MOCK]
================================================================

L001: Scope: build a retrieval system that returns pinpoint citations.
L002: Pinpoint citations must include document ID and a stable location reference.
L003: Output must include a claim-to-evidence map.
L004: If evidence is missing, the system should abstain rather than guess.
L005: The system must log retrieval candidates and scores.
L006: We will evaluate using citation precision and support accuracy.
L007: We will not evaluate stylistic writing quality in this phase.
L008: The pilot will use public or sanitised documents only.
L009: Timeline: deliver a working prototype in 5 business days.
L010: Anything beyond that is optional and should be prioritised after correctness.
