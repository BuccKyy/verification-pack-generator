# Reviewer Notes (Internal)
Suggested quick checks:
- For supported claims, does evidence snippet DIRECTLY support the proposition?
- Are line ranges valid and present in the referenced doc?
- Is INSUFFICIENT used when evidence is missing or merely related?
- Does retrieval_log show candidates even when final evidence is empty?
